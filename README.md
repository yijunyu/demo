# Flattened Abstract Syntax Trees

This repository provides a demonstration of the deep learning package for classifying the code parsed by the [fast
utility](https://cloud.docker.com/u/yijun/repository/docker/yijun/fast). See also the [Visual Studio Code Extension](https://github.com/yijunyu/vscode-fast).

You can run fast in your own machine as the docker container of course, but here you don't even need that: all the binary and python dependencies have been provided, including also the trained models and the pre-trained embeddings.

To reproduce the results, all you need is to [enable the GitPod app to access your GitHub account](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/yijunyu/demo) so that the commands can run on a remote server belonging to yourself.

## Usage of fAST in Deep Learning for Algorithm Classification
Examples of algorithms in Java and C++ are provided to test the algorithm classification deep learning tool. Once your
gitpod machine is running, it will launch the following command:
```bash
run.sh datasets/github_java_10/4/1.java
```
Looks like Tensorflow 1.15 is no longer supported by default. You need to set up an older python environment that is compatible with this older version.

You will see the predicted probabilistic distribution of the class labels: the correctly classified label
will be shown in blue, and the misclassified label will be shown in red.

To understand why, click at the HTML file "datasets/github_java_10/4/1.html" and use the
Preview button on the up-right corner of the tab to see visualisation results
in a split pane.  The colours on the tokens indicate which parts of the code
that have got the most attention by the classification algorithm.

To run another example, type:
```bash
run.sh datasets/github_java_10/4/3.java
run.sh datasets/github_cs_10/4/1.cs
run.sh datasets/github_cpp_10/4/1.cpp
```

In these examples, it shows that even though the model was trained using Java
programs, when applying it to other programming languages such as C# or C++, it
normally works well too. We call this feature "Cross-Language Algorithm
Classification" [Bui et al SANER'19].

## Usage of the fAST utility

```bash
cd datasets

# print the command line options and arguments
fast
# convert a C++ code into protobuffer representation
fast tensorflow-1.0.1/tensorflow/cc/saved_model/loader_test.cc tensorflow-1.0.1/tensorflow/cc/saved_model/loader_test.cc.pb
# convert a Java code into flatbuffers representation
fast RxJava-1.2.9/src/test/java/rx/ErrorHandlingTests.java.java RxJava-1.2.9/src/test/java/rx/ErrorHandlingTests.java.fbs
# convert a flatbuffers representation back to C#
fast corefx-1.0.4/src/System.IO.IsolatedStorage/ref/System.IO.IsolatedStorage.cs.fbs corefx-1.0.4/src/System.IO.IsolatedStorage/ref/System.IO.IsolatedStorage.cs
# slice a program
fast -S -G RxJava-1.2.9/src/test/java/rx/ErrorHandlingTests.java RxJava-1.2.9/src/test/java/rx/ErrorHandlingTests-ggnn.fbs
# diff two programs
fast -D github_java_10/4/1.java github_java_10/4/3.java
```

## Usage of fAST in Bug Localisation

```bash
cd usr/bin

java -cp /workspace/demo/usr/config:/workspace/demo/usr/config/lic:/workspace/demo/usr/lib/ConCodeSe-1.0.0.jar com.concodese.ConCodeSeJettyServerStarter SERVER_PORT=8081
```

### You can call fAST anywhere when you have docker installed:
```bash
alias fast=”docker run -v $PWD:/e yijun/fast”
```
